    <div class="well"><p> Originally from <em>Carbondale, Colorado</em>, I now reside in <em>Portland, Oregon</em> where I am attending <strong>Epicodus.</strong> My hope is to graduate from <strong>Epicodus</strong> with a strong foundation in coding and transistion those skills to the private sector as a means of employment. Specifically, I am interested in back-end work and system design, and possibly transition into electrical or computer engineering. I would also like to work in the energy sector, focusing on clean power. Another possible sector to work in would be security.<br>   Growing up in Colorado, I was always outside, enjoying my surroundings through numerous outdoor sports. The outdoors acurately reflect who I am as a person and have shaped my expierences throughout my formative years. Skiing, kayaking, climbing, fishing, hiking, and general activity kept me entertained year-round. I've yet to explore much of the PNW but my general sense is that it is quite similar to Colorado in terms of outdoor enjoyment. I'm looking forward to some serious exploring and outdoor enjoyment..</p></div>
